            <br />
          <strong>Description</strong>: Unfortunately, the Performing Arts section of the website  at Manhattan.edu is extremely lack luster and does a poor job representing what  the school has to offer. As a member of multiple ensembles i want to create a  website similar to the GoJaspers athletics site that the school has, but for  the Performing Arts department. I hope to showcase the ensembles and talent, as  well as provide an updated recruitment notice and updated event notices. The  school's website does not match the potential of the department, and I hope to  fix that.</p>
